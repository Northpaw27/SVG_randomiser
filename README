SVG logo randomiser v1.0 17/04/14

A way to generate randomised position, scale and rotation of .svg shapes using processing.

The project brief was to design an identity for another member of the GSA com des group. My client was Bob Rafferty. I felt that his identity should be very flexible and able to ‘perform’ as  dance and performance form a major part of his work.

The process began with typographic style sheets to pick a typeface and to try to create a coherent design. Using tracing paper, I created the outline for a reversed out BR, then isolated the remaining elements. After the design was finalised on paper. It was recreated in illustrator and exported out as 6 separate SVG files. I placed a particular focus on the concept of logo families, i.e. a set of two or more images which all represent the same thing.


Programming for the randomiser function was done in processing 2.1. The SVG files need to be saved in the processing sketches data folder. I found a useful function which allows for each randomisation to be saved as a pdf for print. Further research into SVG files showed me that information such as colour could be altered with in the SVG itself. This is useful because processing cannot change the colour of a shape after it has been loaded in.
